Welcome to this project on the Titanic Machine Learning Project with Support Vector Machine Classifier and Random Forests using scikit-learn. In this project, I used Python and scikit-learn to build SVC and random forest, and apply them to predict the survival rate of Titanic passengers.

Data preprocessing is one of the most prominent steps to make an effective prediction model in Machine Learning, and it is often a best practice to use data preprocessing pipelines. In this exercise, I also learned how to build my custom data transformers and chain all these data pre-processing steps using scikit-learn pipelines.

The goal of this project is to predict whether or not a passenger survived based on attributes such as their age, sex, passenger class and so on.

Skills I Developed:

Data Preprocessing Techniques based upon data understanding

Applications of Statistical Metrics

Creating the pipelines for various numerical and categorical attributes

Conventional Machine Learning Algorithms
