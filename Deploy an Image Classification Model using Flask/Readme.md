Welcome to this project on Deploy Image Classification Pre-trained Keras model using Flask. In this project, I got a comprehensive understanding of how to deploy a deep learning model as a web application using the Flask framework.

Developing a machine learning or deep learning model is very important to solve problems using AI. On the other hand, it is equally important to have a knowledge of how to deploy those amazing problem-solving models into such an interface which enables the users to make use of these solutions. Even many apps we use today, like YouTube, Amazon/Flipkart shopping, FaceApps(which predict our gender or age) make use of machine learning and deep learning, and we are able to interact with them using a web interface. So we need to understand how to integrate the models with a web interface so that the users - be them programmers or non-programmers or any other common users - could easily interact and obtain the solutions from these well-trained and well-performing models.

In this project, I understood how to develop a web interface using Flask for a pre-trained TensorFlow 2 model built for predicting the class of an input image.
