The objective of this project is - to use Fashion-MNIST data set to identify (predict) different fashion products (articles) from the given images using Machine Learning algorithms.  In this end-to-end Machine Learning project, I got a hands-on overview of how to methodologically solve a machine learning classification problem. As a part of it, I understood various methods of improvising the models using hyper parameter tuning, dimensionality reduction using the corresponding scikit-learn classes. I also evaluated the performance of my final ensemble model using various performance metrics.
