This project on the Forecasting Bike Rentals with Decision Tree Regressor, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor using scikit-learn. In this project, I used Python and scikit-learn to build models using the above-mentioned algorithms, and apply them to forecast the bike rentals.

Forecasting is a regression problem, which is a highly demanded skill in the real world. This exercise enabled me to understand the basic workflow to solve a regression problem, which includes data preprocessing and data modeling steps. I understood how Pandas and scikit-learn, in association with Python, could be used to solve a machine learning problem end-to-end project.

Skills I developed:

Data preprocessing based upon data Understanding

Applications of Statistical Metrics

Conventional Machine Learning Algorithms
