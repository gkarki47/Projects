Welcome to this project on the Spam Classifier Project with Logistic Regression Classifier using scikit-learn. In this project, I used use Python and scikit-learn to build a Logistic Regression Classifier, and apply it to predict whether an email is Spam or Ham.
The world is full of textual data being generated at a very rapid pace each second. The most important data preprocessing steps include accessing and cleansing the real-time data, transforming it to get a refined form, and making it in an ML-algorithm compatible way by representing the textual data into numerical form. You will learn to achieve all these data preprocessing steps using NLTK - a famous Natural Language Processing API - in conjunction with Python. You will build data transformers and use them in scikit-learn pipelines in order to effectively preprocess the data. Finally, I builded a Logistic Regression Classifier to predict the class of an email.
Skills you will develop:
1.	Textual Data Preprocessing
2.	Data Preprocessing Pipelines
3.	Data Transforming
4.	NLTK
5.	Python Programming
6.	Predictive Modeling
7.	Machine Learning
8.	scikit-Learn

Spam Classifier - About the Spam Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Apache SpamAssassin.

Apache SpamAssassin is the #1 Open Source anti-spam platform giving system administrators a filter to classify email and block spam (unsolicited bulk email).

It uses a robust scoring framework and plug-ins to integrate a wide range of advanced heuristic and statistical analysis tests on email headers and body text including text analysis, Bayesian filtering, DNS blocklists, and collaborative filtering databases.

Apache SpamAssassin is a project of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). You can find more about them from the below link:
